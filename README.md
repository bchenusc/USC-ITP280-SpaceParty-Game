Space-Party
===========

Space Party is a game made by a team for our class ITP 280; it is a collection of 4 games (each programmer made his own game, and the artist provided art for all games).
Each game is essentially a showcase for the Leap Motion, which we had access to before its release.

Programmers: Matthew Pohlmann, Brian Chen, David Zhang, Jeffrey Chau
